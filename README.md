```
from selenium
import webdriver
import time
```

Please be sure that you appropriately add path of your geckodriver to environment variables.

```
browser = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path="C:/Users/oÄŸuz/Desktop/geckodriver")
```

Why do we need time module?

We want to wait until websites are rendered completely, then, we take some actions further on them.

```
time.sleep(5)
```

```
browser.get("https://www.instagram.com")
```

```
time.sleep(5)
```

Please be aware of the DOM elements, so, you can specify the method as you wish.

Reach out to _w3schools.com_ to fully understand the DOM elements.

```
username = browser.find_element_by_name("username")
password = browser.find_element_by_name("password")
```

You will specify your username below between quotes.

```
username.send_keys("")
```

You will specify your password below between quotes.

```
password.send_keys("")
```

login_button = browser.find_element_by_xpath("/html/body/div[1]/section/main/article/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]/form/div/div[3]")

We have to click on the login button to go further. To do that,
click method is utilized.

```
login_button.click()
```

```
time.sleep(5)
```
